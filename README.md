later...could expand it, ie integrating payment system like ERC-20 tokens for license fees?


Register Copyright:

Creators can register a new work by providing its name and an IPFS hash pointing to its metadata.
The contract assigns a unique copyrightId and stores the creator’s address as the owner.
Grant License:

The owner can grant a license for the work by specifying the licensee, price, and duration.
Licenses are stored in a list, and an event is emitted for each license.
Transfer Ownership:

Copyright ownership can be transferred to another address.
Retrieve Licenses:

Anyone can query the licenses associated with a specific copyrightId.


Deploy the Contract:

Use Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle to deploy the contract on a testnet like Goerli or Mumbai.
Interact with the Contract:

Register a work with a sample IPFS hash (e.g., metadata.json stored on IPFS).
Grant a license to a test address.
Transfer ownership of a work to another address.
Retrieve licenses for a specific work.
Tools for the Demo:

Remix IDE: Quickly deploy and interact with the contract.
Frontend:
Use a basic React.js app with ethers.js to build a UI.
Showcase registration, license granting, and ownership transfer.
Test Cases:

Use Hardhat’s testing framework to automate and validate the functionality:
Test registration with valid and invalid inputs.
Ensure only owners can grant licenses.
Verify ownership transfers.
